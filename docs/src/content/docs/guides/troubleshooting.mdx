## Frequently Asked Questions

### What Portainer version is required?

Portainer MCP Server is tested and validated against a specific Portainer CE/EE version.
The required version is checked automatically at startup. You can bypass this check with
the `-disable-version-check` flag, but this is **not recommended** for production use.

### What is the difference between meta-tools and granular tools?

By default, the server exposes **15 meta-tools** — grouped interfaces where related
operations (list, create, update, delete) are selected via an `action` parameter. This
reduces token usage and simplifies discovery for LLM-based clients.

If your MCP client works better with individual tools, use the `-granular-tools` flag
to expose all **98 individual tools** instead.

### Can I use this in read-only mode?

Yes. Pass the `-read-only` flag to restrict the server to read-only operations only.
All write/delete/update tools are excluded when this flag is active.

### Does the server support HTTPS / TLS?

Yes. The server connects to the Portainer API over HTTPS by default. If your Portainer
instance uses a self-signed certificate, pass `-skip-tls-verify` to disable certificate
validation.

<Aside type="caution">
  Skipping TLS verification is not recommended for production environments.

## Common Issues

### Connection refused or timeout

<Steps>
1. Verify the Portainer server is running and accessible from the machine running the MCP server.
2. Check the `-server` URL includes the correct scheme (`https://`) and port.
3. Ensure no firewall or network policy is blocking the connection.
4. Try accessing the Portainer API directly: `curl -k https://your-server:9443/api/status`
</Steps>

### Version mismatch error at startup

The server validates compatibility with your Portainer version. If you see:

```
Error: Portainer version X.Y.Z is not compatible with this MCP server
```

Options:
- **Upgrade Portainer** to the supported version.
- **Bypass the check** with `-disable-version-check` (use at your own risk).

### Authentication failed (401 Unauthorized)

- Verify your API token is valid and not expired.
- Ensure the token has sufficient permissions for the operations you need.
- Admin tokens are required for most management operations.

### Tool not found errors

If your MCP client reports a tool is not available:

- In **meta-tool mode** (default), use the grouped tool name with the `action` parameter.
- In **granular mode** (`-granular-tools`), individual tool names are available.
- In **read-only mode** (`-read-only`), write operations are excluded.

### Docker / Kubernetes proxy errors

Proxy operations forward requests to the Docker or Kubernetes API through Portainer.
Common issues:

- **Environment not found**: Verify the environment ID exists in Portainer.
- **Permission denied**: The API token must have access to the target environment.
- **Invalid API path**: The path must start with `/` and follow the Docker/Kubernetes API specification.

### Build errors after cloning

<Steps>
1. Ensure Go 1.24+ is installed: `go version`
2. Run `go mod download` to fetch dependencies.
3. Build with `make build` or `go build ./...`
4. If using the docs site, install pnpm and run `cd docs && pnpm install`
</Steps>
